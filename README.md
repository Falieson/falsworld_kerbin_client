#Disclaimer
I don't claim ownership to any of the files contained in this repo. This is a pack of files required to connect to Falsworld Kerbal Space Program DarkMultiplayer server.

#Instructions
1. Place the Gamedata folder in your Kerbal Space Program game directory. 
1. Allow it to merge into the existing Gamedata folder and copy over the full contents.

The first time you run the game it will take a long time to load. After that it will load quickly each time. This is caused by the ActiveTextureManagement mod, which offers better than stock texture compression.
